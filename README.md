# form_validation_simple

This is the source code of the demo that is shown in my talk [Elegant Form Validation in Flutter](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/157ynN4mF-qa9C01RVJdch-UjmLDCv00pUGezf_EtI54/edit?usp=sharing).

To run the app, make sure you register for account at [FavQs](https://favqs.com) and get an API key. Assuming that you use VS Code to run the app, rename the `launch.json.example` file in `.vscode/` directory to `launch.json`, and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with a valid API key. Enjoy!

This repository contains packages that are part of the [materials](https://github.com/kodecocodes/rwf-materials) that accompany the Real-World Flutter by Tutorials book. They reside in the `packages/` folder. I would highly recommend any intermediate users of Flutter to get the book :)
