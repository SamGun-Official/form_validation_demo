# form_validation_simple

This is the source code of the demo that is shown in my talk [Elegant Form Validation in Flutter](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/157ynN4mF-qa9C01RVJdch-UjmLDCv00pUGezf_EtI54/edit?usp=sharing).

This repository contains packages that are part of the [materials](https://github.com/kodecocodes/rwf-materials) that accompany the Real-World Flutter by Tutorials book. They reside in the `packages/` folder. I would highly recommend any intermediate users of Flutter to get the book :)
